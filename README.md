# bilight
An Android application that controls RGBW and RGBWW lightbulbs at the same time, without having to switch "Remotes" like in the original application. Unlike the original, this application works on Android 2.3.3 and up. Only compatible with the Milight v6 protocol(!)

As the current version completely works for me, I have suspended development. However, feel free to commit a pull request, or, drop me a line.
